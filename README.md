### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Sura Qalalwa ðŸ¦‹

I am a self-taught Software Engineer who fell in love with coding! I enjoy learning new technologies. I came from a non-traditional background. I studied Energy Engineering in An-Najah University. I have experience in PV systems design.

My interest in computer science started when I began using PV systems software at my job. My curiosity led me to read more about programming to better understand how the software itself worked. I started taking online programming courses, and I was fascinated by how coding can teach me to think, to be creative, and to go beyond my imagination.

After teaching myself to code for a year, I decided to join Coding Dojo bootcamp to gain the opportunity to work on dev teams, collaborate with others, and to help other students, I learned 3 full stacks within 3 months (MEAN, JAVA, Python), and built many projects using different technologies.

Skills: MERN/JavaScript/ Python/CSS/HTML
